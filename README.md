pr0nbot
===

pr0nbot the the most hilarious, while simultaneously being the most absurd, reddit bot.

The idea is simple: troll reddit posters by detecting if pictures contain prawn (not to be confused with pr0n), then commenting that the image should be tagged as `NSFW`, there are children are present, and OP should feel shame.

Process
-------

1. Poll /r/pics for images posted.
1. Using trained AI model, detect if the image contains prawn.
1. If prawn detected, post scorn.
